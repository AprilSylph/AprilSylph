### Preamble

Hi there. If you're reading this, you probably got here because you want to know how my software interacts with your data. So, let me disclose that upfront before we get to the legalese:

My software (defined as software that is published under my name, April Sylph, and not under the name of any company or organisation) collects only the data that is strictly necessary for the operation of the software. This data is stored locally on your computer and is not transmitted to me or to any third parties, except in cases where you voluntarily transmit that data (e.g. you upload a config export for debugging purposes).

Basically, I don't make spyware.

Because you can send me email relating to my software, I have a legal requirement to disclose how I will handle the personal information received in those messages. As a summary: I will receive your name, email address, and message as sent in your email to me; I have no interest in using these for any purposes other than replying to your email.

The full legal privacy notice can be found below.
